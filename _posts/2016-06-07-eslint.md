Hinting / Linting your JavaScript is a way to detect errors and potential problems (to make our code run properly), and to enforce a style guide (to make our code more readable).

ESLint is current industry standard way of doing this.

Install ESLint using npm:

```
npm install eslint --save
```

Then run the setup:

```
$ eslint --init
```

and answer the questions it asks like this:

```
? How would you like to configure ESLint? Answer questions about your style
? Are you using ECMAScript 6 features? No
? Where will your code run? Node
? Do you use CommonJS? No
? Do you use JSX? No
? What style of indentation do you use? Spaces
? What quotes do you use for strings? Double
? What line endings do you use? Unix
? Do you require semicolons? Yes
? What format do you want your config file to be in? JavaScript
Successfully created .eslintrc.js file in /Users/<username>/<app-location>
```

Run the linter by giving it a filename or names. For example, to check all the js files in the current directory, run:

```
eslint *.js
```

It also comes with a magical "fix" command that, erm, fixes your code for you. ðŸŽ‰
Run it like this:

```
eslint *.js --fix
```

If you're using Atom for your editor, you can add the `linter-eslint` plugin to lint as you code.
