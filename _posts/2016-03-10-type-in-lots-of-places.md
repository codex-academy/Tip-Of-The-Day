# Type in lots of places

If you're in Atom or Sublime and you need to change the same piece of text in a bunch of places, you can use this nifty trick called Multiple Selection.

* Select the first one.
* Press `Ctrl + d` to select the next one.
* Keep pressing `Ctrl + d` until you've selected all the ones you want to change.
* Now you've got multiple selections, and you can type in several places at once!
