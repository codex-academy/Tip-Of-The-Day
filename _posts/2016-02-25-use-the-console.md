# Use the console

If your code isn't doing what you expect, there might be an error somewhere. A quick way to check is to look in the console. Open your browser's **Developer Tools** and select the **Console** tab.

If there's an error, the console tells you:

* how many errors there are;
* what the errors are;
* where the error is.

Like this:
