# Use `Ctrl + /` to comment code

Click anywhere in a line then press `Ctrl + /` (or `Cmd + /` if you're using a Mac) to comment out the whole line. You don't need to highlight the whole line first!

Select several lines and press `Ctrl + /` to comment out all the lines in the selection.

Noice! :D
